    <p>Hi! I'm Leo and welcome to my website.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack software engineer based in Seattle, Washington and currently working for Liberty Mutual
      Insurance.

    <p>
      Messing around with the terminal emulator on MacOS when I was a kid was my introduction to command line interfaces and interacting with an OS in this way helped start my interest in computers and programming.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      This website is designed as a love letter to that, serving as an interactive resume to share my work experience, side projects, and external links.
      <br>There's also text art, an info tool based on Neofetch, and multiple color themes (my personal favorite back on the MacOS terminal was Ocean).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Hope you enjoy using my site!
